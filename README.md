# KMarkAero-3D_Rocket

Rocket Viewer
------------

v0.0: Code from CS-174A Assignment 3

v0.1: Can generate a rough rocket shape (cylinder, cone, fins)
	- Uses flat shading with framework for smooth shadings
	BUGS: Normals are not handled correctly, resulting in problems
	shading certain surfaces
	
v0.2: Partial implementation of polygon data structure

v0.5: Initial kinks ironed out- foundation mostly complete
	- Operational implementation of polygon data structure (may
	  add a way to traverse facets around each vertex in the future)
	- Geometry/polygon generation is now well organized
	- Normal vectors are generated automatically from polygon data
	- Normal vectors are transformed properly even with non-uniform 
	  scaling
	  
v0.5.1: Removed unnecessary files from directory, updated readme

Development and testing done on a Windows 10 PC with Edge.
